Data Reviews Online (Dareon) is an application that assists in the 
process of submission and review of proposals for the inclusion of 
datasets into a data repository. It helps with the management of 
Calls for Proposals and the associated proposal review process. 

Dareon is designed to help Repository Owners, Dataset Owners, and 
Proposal Reviewers.

In addition, Dareon includes classification schemes to help match 
Reviewers with appropriate Proposals.
