Data Reviews Online (Dareon) is an application that assists in the 
process of submission and review of proposals for the inclusion of 
datasets into a data repository. It helps with the management of a
*Call for Proposals* (CfP) and the associated proposal review process. 

Dareon is designed to help Repository Owners, Dataset Owners, and 
Proposal Reviewers.

Also, Dareon includes classification schemes to help match 
Reviewers with appropriate Proposals.

## Getting Started


To get started:

- read the overview or the application: [about]({{ site.baseurl }}/about)
- log into the demos site: [demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo)
- dig deeper into the code repositories: [GitHub](https://github.com/dareon-org)

## How can you get involved?
Dareon was initially developed to help manage the review process for the 
**Research Data Grants Program** at 
[RMIT University](https://rmit.edu.au) in Melbourne, Australia.
It is at an early stage of evolution and would benefit greatly from a 
wider base of collaborators, that could provide a more diverse set of 
use-cases or development resources.

Please contact us if you would like to help
develop Dareon further.
