## What is Data Reviews Online?

Data Reviews Online (Dareon) is an application that assists in the 
process of submission and review of proposals for the inclusion of 
datasets into a data repository. It helps with the management of 
Calls for Proposals and the associated proposal review process. 

In addition, Dareon includes classification schemes to help match 
Reviewers with appropriate Proposals.

## Getting Started

Dareon is designed to help Repository Owners, Dataset Owners, and 
Proposal Reviewers.

To get started, log in via the Australian Access Federation and 
updated your profile. 
Then you will be able to: manage your repositories, submit proposals, 
or register as a reviewer, depending on your role.
